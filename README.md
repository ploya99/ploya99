- üëÄ About me...
- Grew up in Thailand with the determination to find a way to the US. Awarded a full scholarship at age 17 to Saint Cloud State in Minnesota where I quickly embraced American culture and graduated in three short years.  While in college, I was able to work full time as the #1 personal banker in my Wells Fargo region and represented my birth country as Miss Thailand USA 2015. After graduating with distinction, I joined Morgan Stanley as a financial advisor and built a successful book of business. Quick and resourceful learner focused on personal and professional growth. Recognizing the importance of being well-rounded, I learned to golf and skiing which enabled me to find numerous business opportunities engaging in conversations and meeting people on the course and in the mountains.
